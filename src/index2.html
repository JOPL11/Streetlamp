        <div class="text-container" id="text1">Los Angeles, 2052</div>
        <div class="text-container" id="p1">In the rain-soaked, neon-drenched streets of a Los Angeles that reached for the sky but got lost in the clouds, I walk. Or maybe that’s just the script I follow, every click of my boots on the wet asphalt scripted in some cosmic code we haven't yet cracked. See, I'm a blade runner, but sometimes I wonder if I'm just another character in someone's digital fever dream.</div>
        <div class="text-container" id="p2">Up above, the city's a circus of aircars—sleek, shining, and out of their damn minds. Ever since humanity cut the leash and took to the skies, sanity seemed to stay grounded. Now, every Joe and Jane with a set of wings thinks they're the next ace in the pocket, dodging, weaving, and careening through the concrete canyons like gravity’s just another bad joke they heard on the way up.</div>
        <div class="text-container" id="p3">Traffic’s a nightmare at five hundred feet, a ballet of chaos where the dancers are blind and the music’s too fast. Everyone’s in a rush to get nowhere, leaving reason in the rearview. And here I am, wondering if any of this is real, or just another loop in the endless simulation. Makes you think—if life’s a game, who’s playing whom?</div>
